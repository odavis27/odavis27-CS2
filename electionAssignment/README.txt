How to use:

    First, on the file main.py, scroll down to lines 31, 32, and 33. On these lines, change
the variables information in order to change how to use the file. 

Variable file_name should be the name of the file (within the same folder that the main.py file is in) 
but without any file extensions at the end. For example, if the name of the file you want to use is 
test_file.txt you would set the variable on file_name on line 31 to just "test_file"

Next is show_graph. This can be either True or False. At True, the program will open a new window displaying
the data as a bar graph. If false, it will only make a csv file and not display it in a graph.

Finally, there is words_to_graph. This variable should be an integer and it determines how many words you want
in your final csv file/graph.

After changing the variables to how you need them, simply run the file and a csv file will be created and
a graph (if you choose that)
