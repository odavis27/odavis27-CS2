The accual code for the functions is located in the file "stringManipulationFunctions.py".
If you would like to easily test the functions, follow the steps below. Alternatively,
if you want to test a specific function or to test a the function's output without the adjustments to make the output look nicer, you can call a function directly in the "stringManipulationFunctions.py" file.

How to easily test the functions:
    In order to save some time testing the functions I made a file which will run all the functions. To use the testing file,open the file "test_functions.py" and then run the file.
    
    Upon running it, you will be prompted to input "word" or "name". 

    When inserting "word" you will be asked again for a word. Then, the following functions will be ran on input word and will format the output to look better:
        - reverse
        - get_vowels
        - get_consonants
        - uppercase
        - lowercase
    When inserting "name" you will be asked again for a name. Then, the following functions will be ran on input name and format the output to look better.
        - get_first_name
        - get_last_name
        - get_middle_name
        - contains_title
        - last_name_contains_hyphen
        - randomize_name
        - is_first_name_palindrome
        - get_initials
        - get_sorted_first_name
